## Proof by Case Analysis

The next tool for formal proofs will be case analysis, which means using *pattern matching* in the proof. For example, let's prove that the logical AND of anything and False is always False:

```rust,ignore
Example_case_analysis (b: Bool) : Equal Bool (Andb b1 Bool.false) Bool.false
Example_case_analysis b = ?
```

Although it may seem like a proof that could be solved simply with ``Equal.refl``, it's not the case. This is because the ``Andb`` function pattern matches on the first argument, and we don't have its value in the proof, so it remains "stuck".

To give a value to it and show that the proof is correct for both ``Bool`` values, we *pattern match* in the proof, creating two different proofs: one for when ``b`` is ``Bool.true`` and one for when it's ``Bool.false``.

```rust,ignore
Example_case_analysis (b: Bool) : Equal Bool (Andb b Bool.false) Bool.false
Example_case_analysis Bool.true  = ?
Example_case_analysis Bool.false = ?
```

And both of these proofs are directly solvable with ``Equal.refl``, since the *type checker* can reduce both of them to ``Equal Bool.false Bool.false`` directly.

```rust,ignore
Example_case_analysis (b: Bool) : Equal Bool (Andb b Bool.false) Bool.false
Example_case_analysis Bool.true  = Equal.refl
Example_case_analysis Bool.false = Equal.refl
```
